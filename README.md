# CLI Spotify
I'm just think about why switch terminal to spotify to change track if i can change track right in the terminal via simply cli util? So, there i implement spotify cli controller.

# Prerequirements
See requirements.txt

# How use it?
- Clone repo
- Get [spotify token](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/)
- Run `configure.sh` this way `. ./configure.sh` cos this should executes in the context of the current shell, not as a sub shell.
- `spot --help`
